## Authentication and Authorization

### JWT Implementation

**Findings:**
- The application uses JWT for authentication, which is a standard approach.
- Tokens are stored in localStorage, which poses a potential XSS risk.
- Token refresh mechanism is implemented correctly.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider using HttpOnly cookies for token storage instead of localStorage to mitigate XSS risks.
- Implement token rotation on critical actions (password change, etc.).
- Add fingerprinting to tokens to prevent token theft across devices.

### Password Security

**Findings:**
- Password validation enforces strong passwords.
- Passwords are properly hashed on the backend.
- No evidence of password transmission in plain text.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement password breach detection using services like "Have I Been Pwned".
- Add support for WebAuthn/FIDO2 for passwordless authentication.
- Consider implementing a password strength meter on the frontend.

### Multi-Factor Authentication

**Findings:**
- MFA is not currently implemented.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement TOTP-based MFA (Google Authenticator, Authy).
- Add support for SMS or email verification codes as a fallback.
- Consider WebAuthn for biometric authentication where supported.

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

**Findings:**
- API keys and credentials are not hardcoded in the frontend code.
- Personal user information is properly encrypted during transmission.
- Some sensitive data may be cached in Redux store.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement a data classification policy to identify all sensitive data.
- Add encryption for sensitive data in Redux store.
- Implement automatic purging of sensitive data when not needed.

### Data Encryption

**Findings:**
- HTTPS is enforced for all communications.
- No client-side encryption for stored data.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement client-side encryption for any sensitive data stored locally.
- Use the Web Crypto API for client-side encryption operations.
- Ensure proper key management for encryption/decryption operations.

## API Security

### Input Validation

**Findings:**
- Zod is used for input validation, which is a strong approach.
- Some API endpoints may not have comprehensive validation.

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure all API endpoints have proper input validation.
- Implement API schema validation on both client and server.
- Add runtime type checking for all API responses.

### Rate Limiting

**Findings:**
- Rate limiting is implemented on the backend but not enforced on the frontend.

**Recommendations:**
- Add client-side throttling for API requests to prevent accidental DoS.
- Implement exponential backoff for retries.
- Add user feedback for rate limit errors.

### CORS Configuration

**Findings:**
- CORS is properly configured on the backend.
- Preflight requests are handled correctly.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly review and update CORS policies.
- Implement stricter origin checking in production.

## Frontend Security

### XSS Protection

**Findings:**
- React's built-in XSS protection is utilized.
- User-generated content is properly sanitized.
- Some third-party libraries may introduce XSS vulnerabilities.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
- Use DOMPurify for any HTML rendering from user input.
- Regularly audit third-party dependencies for security vulnerabilities.

### CSRF Protection

**Findings:**
- CSRF protection is not explicitly implemented.
- JWT in Authorization header provides some protection.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement CSRF tokens for sensitive operations.
- Add SameSite=Strict for cookies.
- Verify Origin/Referer headers for sensitive operations.

### Dependency Security

**Findings:**
- Some npm packages may have known vulnerabilities.
- No automated dependency scanning in place.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement npm audit in CI/CD pipeline.
- Add Snyk or similar tool for dependency vulnerability scanning.
- Set up automated dependency updates with security reviews.

## Deployment and Infrastructure

### CI/CD Security

**Findings:**
- CI/CD pipeline lacks security scanning steps.
- Secrets management needs improvement.

**Recommendations:**
- Add SAST (Static Application Security Testing) to CI/CD pipeline.
- Implement secrets scanning to prevent credential leakage.
- Add dependency vulnerability scanning to build process.

### Infrastructure Security

**Findings:**
- Netlify deployment provides good baseline security.
- Security headers are not fully implemented.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement all recommended security headers.
- Enable Netlify's asset fingerprinting.
- Set up regular security scans of deployed application.

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

**Findings:**
- User data handling generally follows GDPR principles.
- Data retention policies are not clearly defined.
- No explicit consent management system.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement a comprehensive consent management system.
- Define and enforce data retention policies.
- Add data export and deletion capabilities for users.

### Accessibility and Security

**Findings:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is a project goal.
- Some security features may impact accessibility.

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure security features are accessible (e.g., MFA for screen readers).
- Test security flows with accessibility tools.
- Document accessibility considerations for security features.

## Recommendations
